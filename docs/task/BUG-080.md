## Summary
Prevent duplicate Claude process spawns caused by state transitions that mark a still-alive process as completed between turns.

## Scope
- Keep managed process state aligned with subprocess liveness.
- Add turn-settled semantics for DB/event handling without forcing new spawn.
- Add follow-up spawn safety guard for existing process cleanup.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Follow-up does not spawn duplicate process for same issue/session.
- Process state remains consistent between turn completion and next follow-up.
- Relevant guards are covered by focused verification.

## Notes
- Original source of truth before migration: `task.md` BUG-080 entry.
